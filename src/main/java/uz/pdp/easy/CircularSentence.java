//        Hint
//A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
//
//For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
//Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.
//
//A sentence is circular if:
//
//The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
//The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.
//For example, "leetcode exercises sound delightful", "eetcode", "leetcode eats soul" are all circular sentences. However, "Leetcode is cool", "happy Leetcode", "Leetcode" and "I like Leetcode" are not circular sentences.
//
//Given a string sentence, return true if it is circular. Otherwise, return false.
public class CircularSentence {
    // This method checks if a sentence is circular - where each word's last letter
    // matches the next word's first letter, and the last word's last letter matches
    // the first word's first letter
    public boolean isCircularSentence(String sentence) {
        // First check: verify if the first and last characters of the entire string match
        // This handles the requirement that the sentence should be circular
        if (sentence.charAt(0) != sentence.charAt(sentence.length() - 1))
            return false;

        // Find the first space in the string
        int k = sentence.indexOf(" ");

        // If there are no spaces, it means there's only one word
        // In this case, we already checked if first and last letters match
        if (k == -1)
            return true;

        // Iterate through all spaces in the string
        while (k != -1) {
            // For each space found:
            // Check if the character before the space (last letter of current word)
            // matches the character after the space (first letter of next word)
            if (sentence.charAt(k - 1) != sentence.charAt(k + 1)) {
                return false;
            }

            // Find the next space in the string, starting from position after current space
            k = sentence.indexOf(" ", k + 1);
        }

        // If we've made it through all checks, the sentence is circular
        return true;
