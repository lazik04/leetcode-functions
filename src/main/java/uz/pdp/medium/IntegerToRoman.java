//Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:
//Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

//If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
//If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
//Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
